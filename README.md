# DisasterResponse.AI

A decentralized, autonomous disaster response system leveraging AI agents, drones, and blockchain technology.

## Project Overview

In disasters where traditional communication and coordination fail, our project introduces a decentralized, autonomous disaster response system. We deploy a network of AI agents—global, regional, and local—that continuously monitor environments for signs of disasters. Upon detecting an event, these agents collaborate through a consensus mechanism to confirm the disaster, collect data, and coordinate responses.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Agents**: AI agents detect and validate disasters, working seamlessly with human responders
- **Sensor Integration**: Real-time data collection from IoT sensors and autonomous drones
- **Consensus System**: AI agents reach consensus on disaster detection and response strategies
- **Resource Coordination**: Automated coordination of emergency resources and rescue efforts

## Technology Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

## Getting Started
